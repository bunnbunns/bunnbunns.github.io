			<h1>Blazing Star</h1>
			<img src="images/blazingstar.jpg">
			<p>Blazing Star (Liatris spicata) is a tall, upright, clump-forming perennial native to moist meadows and marshes. It gets puffy, feathery, deep purple flowers in the summer, attracting bees, birds, and butterflies. Namely it is a host plant to the lovely Schinia gloriosa, or the Glorious Flower Moth, which is able to camouflage itself on the flower stalk. While it prefers wet soil, it is tolerant of clay soils and drought. This makes it an excellent plant to use in rain gardens. It looks lovely as a massed perennial border in cottage style or native gardens as well as prairie type areas. Overall this is a stunning, low maintenance addition to any garden!</p>

			<h1>Butterfly Weed</h1>
			<img src="images/butterflyweed.JPG">
			<p>Butterfly weed is a coarse perennial forb consisting of many stems. The stems are straight and very hairy. The leaves are alternate and simple. Unlike other species of milkweed butterfly weed does not contain the characteristic thick milky sap but instead has a watery translucent sap. The inflorescence is slightly rounded to flat and made up many individual flowers. The flower consists of five petals pointing down and topped by a crown of five erect hoods. The fruit is a pod containing numerous brown seed each with a tuft of silky white hairs. Many a child and adult have gleefully pulled the seeds from a ripened, opened pod and let them float gracefully on a gentle breeze.</p>

	<p>The good thing about being a birdwatcher – or a “birder” – is that you can do it at all levels – and in principle, at all times. Birds are ubiquitous, and available regardless of whether you are a “hardcore twitcher ” or just a happy amateur who finds pleasure in knowing the name of the birds you meet on your travels. You can watch birds during a cruise, on a hike, or simply by just looking out the window. If you are a little more dedicated, you can choose to plan your trip to Greenland so that you actively seek out sites where there is a high concentration of birds, a lot of diversity, or perhaps a very special bird species that is not found in many other places in the world.</p>

	<p>Regardless of what level of bird watching you are at, knowledge of bird species gives an extra dimension to the overall nature experience! For many people, it’s exciting to be able to tell what kinds of birds you are seeing during your trip to Greenland. If you look further into the birds’ behaviour, adaptations and biology, it can also open up a better understanding of the local environment and ecological context, which enriches your experience of nature.</p>

	<p>Birdlife in Greenland is characterised by the fact that there are only a few different species. However, this means that with relatively little effort you can get to know the most common bird species, and, in this way, quickly be ready to begin your bird adventure in Greenland.</p>

	<p>In principle, you can watch birds without binoculars and get a good experience out of it. But if you want to identify the species of the birds, see them from a further distance and appreciate the details of their appearance and behaviour, binoculars are a must to complete the nature experience. Binoculars are available in all sizes and price categories, and it is important to find a pair that fits your level as a birdwatcher. However, all experience points to the rule that one ends up regretting one’s purchases when shopping at the cheapest price level!</p>

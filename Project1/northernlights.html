	<p><em>What are the Northern Lights really?</em> Northern lights are electrically charged particles from the sun, which hit our atmosphere, and create a natural phenomenon of light with altering colors, revealing how far above our planet the particles are, when they hit the atmosphere.</p>

	<p>But is this scientific explanation of the Aurora Borealis really the reason why we, time after time, stop in our tracks when the northern lights flash across the night sky? Or are we reminded of something greater than ourselves, something almost magical that will even entice Greenlanders, who are thoroughly accustomed to seeing the northern lights, to look up at the night sky.</p>

	<p>We know for a fact that the same fascination that we feel and that you will feel while visiting, in a similar manner also challenged the imagination of our ancestors. In a well-known myth, we are told that when the northern lights dance across the night sky, it is the dead who are playing soccer with the skull of a walrus.</p>

	<p>Even today people from some nations believe that children will be particularly intelligent if they are conceived on a night when the northern lights are visible in the sky. If that is the case, then one would think that we as a nation must be doing unbelievably well.</p>
